We were fortunate that the timing of our trip allowed for visits to a Sumo tournament, a baseball game, a Geisha dinner and a dinner in the home of a local family. Those events along with Shinto Shrines, Buddhist Temples, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, fantastic trains, and intriguing foods we couldn't have asked for a better trip.</p>

                            <p class = "text">I had a great time on my tour of Notre dame. This was my second time in Paris, my first was in September of 2019 which was a few months after the fire. Things were still a bit chaotic and because my family and I couldnâ€™t go inside we just settled for looking at it.
                                I was disappointed because I had always wanted to see it up close, loving its architecture.
                                Amber our tour guide did a lovely job of telling us the history of the church and the surrounding area and made it interesting and fun. I learned more on this tour than I did on any other tour I took this week.</p>

We learned so much during our tour and we didn't want it to end. The weather was a little cold and wet but he made sure to give us breaks so we could warm up. He also kept us all laughing from his jokes and overall personality. Highly recommend this tour to anyone and if you get Jonathan then you are in for a treat.</p>
